## 📌 Project Overview

This system uses **YOLOv8 Small (yolov8s)** to detect playing cards in real time. The trained model is exported to **ONNX format** and deployed through a browser-based HTML interface — no installation required.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Train a deep learning model to detect all 52 playing cards
- Deploy through a browser-based interface using ONNX Runtime
- Run entirely locally — no cloud or API calls needed
- Achieve real-time detection with confidence scores

## 📊 Results

### Final Validation Metrics (Best Model — Epoch 162):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **mAP50** | **99.4%** |
| **mAP50-95** | **90.1%** |
| Precision | 96.9% |
| Recall | 98.0% |

### Training Progress Highlights:

| Epoch | mAP50 | mAP50-95 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1.05% | 0.68% |
| 20 | 68.4% | 47.5% |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Training Pipeline:
```
Roboflow Dataset → Google Colab → YOLOv8 Training
→ PyTorch Model (.pt) → ONNX Export (.onnx) → Download
```

### Deployment Pipeline:
```
User Browser → Load ONNX Model → Access Webcam
→ Capture Frame → Preprocess (640×640, normalize)
→ Model Inference → NMS Post-processing
→ Draw Bounding Boxes → Display on Canvas
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1 — Train the Model (Google Colab)
```bash
# Open Card_Detection_Model_1.ipynb in Google Colab
# Run all cells to train the model
# Download: runs/detect/card_detector_v2/weights/best.onnx
```

### Step 2 — Run the Web Interface
1. Save `playing_card_detection.html` to your local machine
2. Place `best.onnx` in the **same folder**
3. Open the HTML file in **Chrome or Edge**
4. Click **"Choose Model File"** → select `best.onnx`
5. Wait for ✅ green message: *"Model loaded! Ready to detect cards"*
6. Allow webcam access
7. Click **Start Detection**

### Step 3 — Start Detecting!
- Hold any playing card in front of your webcam
- The system will detect and label it with a bounding box and confidence score

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Model won't load | Make sure best.onnx is selected via "Choose Model File" button |
| All stats showing 0 | Upload ONNX file first, then click Start Detection |
| Low FPS in browser | Normal — browser runs on CPU only, not GPU |
| Camera not working | Allow camera permission in Chrome/Edge |
| Card not detected | Hold card flat, ensure good lighting, use Chrome |
